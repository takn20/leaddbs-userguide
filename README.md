# Introduction

## Introduction

The _Lead-DBS Toolbox_ is a **MATLAB**-based toolbox with several subparts that work ideally together. _Lead-DBS_ is a toolbox that allows the user to **localize** and **visualize** in a 3D model electrodes in patients treated with _**deep brain stimulation**_. _Lead-Connectome_ is a toolbox entailed with functional and structural whole-brain connectome analyses.

This manual focuses on the _Lead-DBS_ subpart of the toolbox.

## Key Features

* Linear and nonlinear normalization of MRI and CT images to MNI space
* Reconstruction of the electrode trajectories
* Manual correction of the electrode localization
* Visualization of results in 2D slice views
* Visualization of a 3D model showing DBS electrodes and their target areas
* Calculation of the Volume of Activated Tissue (VAT) and visualization of the structural connectivity from the VAT to other brain areas

## Quick-Start primers

If you're looking for a quick start to try it out, [click here if you have postoperative CT data](http://www.lead-dbs.org/?page\_id=220) or [here if you have postoperative MR data](http://www.lead-dbs.org/?page\_id=225).
