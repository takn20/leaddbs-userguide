# 2. Import Data

_Lead-DBS_ can process different image views. However, the image files must have a **specific name format** for them to be recognized. The naming scheme can be changed in the _**ea\_prefs.m**_ file within the LEAD installation directory. If you use the built-in DICOM import function, you are asked to specify the type of each acquisition within a GUI and thus don't have to do the naming manually.

## DICOM import

to start with DICOM images, simply put all files into a \(blank\) patient folder.  
For instance, if your patient's ID is called `pat_001`, you would create a blank folder called `pat_001` and put all DICOM files into the folder `pat_001`. In _Lead-DBS_, simply select the folder `pat`001 to start and choose \(only\) the checkbox Import DICOM and/or assign NIfTI images and press run. Raw DICOM data will be moved into a subfolder \(`pat001/DICOM`\). Acquisitions will be converted to NIfTI format and for each sequence, you will be prompted by the GUI to assign it to a specific acquisition type. In these windows that will pop up, select e.g. whether the image shown to you is a pre- or postoperative MR image and/or of what type.

If you don't start with DICOM images but instead already have your files converted to NIfTI format, you can either assign the images with the same command, or simply rename each acquisition manually according to the next passage:

## File Naming Format

Please note that you should decide whether you have postoperative MRI or CT. If both acquisitions were taken from a patient, you need to choose which one you prefer, i.e. combining both is not \(yet\) possible in _Lead-DBS_.

Pre-operative images:

* * `anat_t2.nii` / `anat_t1.nii` / `anat_pd.nii`
    * if you name your file `anat_t2.nii`, _Lead-DBS_ assumes that it is a T2-weighted image. If you instead name it `anat_t1.nii`, it assumes that it is a T1-weighted image \(`anat_pd.nii` for the rare case of proton density imaging\).
    * You can also use several \(e.g. T2 and T1 weighted images\) for combined normalizations using the ANTs multimodal normalization or all SPM based approaches.
  * `anat_*.nii` images
    * These could e.g. be special acquisitions that could help highlight the basal ganglia \(like FGATIR/QSM or similar\). These will be used as additional spectrums to segment grey from white matter in all SPM based normalization algorithms \(i.e. SPM Segment, SPM DARTEL and SPM SHOOT\).
  * `dti.nii`for fiber tracking images\*
  * `dti.bvec`for dti bvec table\*
  * `dti.bval`for dti bval table\*
  * _these three files are automatically generated if you convert DICOM to nifti using the popular_ [_dcm2nii_](https://www.nitrc.org/projects/mricron) _software \(part of MRIcron\) , or newer_ [_dcm2niix_](https://www.nitrc.org/projects/mricrogl/)
* Post-operative images:
  * _Either_ you use **MR imaging** files within each folder must have the following format:
    * `postop_tra.nii` for transversal images
    * `postop_cor.nii` for coronal images
    * `postop_sag.nii` for sagittal images
  * _Or_ you use **CT imaging** files within each folder must have the following format:
    * `postop_ct.nii`\(if CT images have not been coregistered to the `anat.nii` file\).
    * `rpostop_ct.nii` \(if CT images have already been coregistered to the `anat.nii` file\)

You can download a Nifti-Viewing software such as [MRIcron](https://www.nitrc.org/projects/mricron) to view the different image files and help in correct naming. [SPM12](http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm12/) needs to be installed \(this program can also be used to visualize the images\).

For Mac users, [the DTI-TK Quicklook plugin](http://dti-tk.sourceforge.net/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=QuicklookPlugin.Main) is extremely helpful when dealing with NIfTI data on a mac, in general. I'd even say it's **a must have** \(and really easy to install\).
