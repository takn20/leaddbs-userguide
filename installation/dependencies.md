# Dependencies

_Lead-DBS_ can be seen as a collection of useful tools that have been gathered together for the purpose of DBS electrode reconstructions and related processing. The core job of our development team is to find and plug in the best neuroimaging tools available within the open-source community and write bits of pieces of own code where no good code can be found. 3D-visualizations and electrode reconstruction algorithms \([TRAC/CORE](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811914009938)\) have been built by ourselves. As for other parts of the toolbox, we aim at incorporating the best tools available. For instance, normalizations into MNI space can be done from within _Lead-DBS_ by either [DARTEL](http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm12/) or [ANTs](http://stnava.github.io/ANTs/), both of which have shown superior to all 12 competing algorithms in [Klein 2009](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19195496). As for Fibertracking, _Lead-DBS_ among other routines uses the [Gibbs' tracking algorithm](https://www.uniklinik-freiburg.de/mr-en/research-groups/diffperf/fibertools.html), which showed superior to all 9 competing algorithms in [Fillard 2011](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21256221). Thus, _Lead-DBS_ heavily depends on shared libraries and other tools that should be referenced properly if used for research projects.
